# Descriptions
## Tribute Page
This is my tribute page for the creator of my favorite and first programming language, Guido van Rossum. 
Thanks to his amazing work, I can take my first steps of the coding journey in the Winter of 2020.
Thus, I want to create this website as a thank-you to him.
## Survey Form
This is my replication of the Google Forms for my MOSCED Calculator Survey. 
Besides the basic elements, I also tried to customized it better, with more features.
## Product Landing Page
This is my page introducing you to my favorite dishes in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). These are definitely the food I remember the most studying abroad here.
## Technical Documentation Page
I have done the page introducing beginners to Data Structures in Python. All information I had on this was from the Tuturial of https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/. I hope that this would inspire other people to learn how to code.
## Personal Portfolio Webpage
This is my Portfolio Page where I list my introduction as well as all my projects. Hope you enjoy it!
