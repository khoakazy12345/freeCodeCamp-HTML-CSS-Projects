# Descriptions
## Tribute Page
This is my tribute page for the creator of my favorite and first programming language, Guido van Rossum. 
Thanks to his amazing work, I can take my first steps of the coding journey in the Winter of 2020.
Thus, I want to create this website as a thank-you to him.
## Survey Form
This is my replication of the Google Forms for my MOSCED Calculator Survey. 
Besides the basic elements, I also tried to customized it better, with more features.
## Product Landing Page
This is my page introducing you to my favorite dishes in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). These are definitely the food I remember the most studying abroad here.
## Technical Documentation Page
